# Arknights_Terminal
An command-line application for Arknights data checking
[en]  
this is a python terminal for Arknights data searching.  
for developers:  
the data structure for "data.xp1"(acually txt file but a different postfix) is rather simple:  
[["name",height,[birthmonth,birthday],"foreign name",type,gender,star,organization,"drawer"],……]  
it's just a huge list with everything inside.  
to use this,"eval()" will be a great choice.  
also,description.xp1 is very similar to data.xp1,and it contains a dict instead of a list
P.S.type,organization and gender information is stored in "int" mode,the translation tuple is in the terminal.  
for users:  
ignore everything above and just run the .exe file. Goodluck.

开发者肯定看得懂上面在说什么  
为用户：  
下载所有文件，运行"for user"文件夹里的.exe，完事儿。
