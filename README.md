# Arknights_Terminal
An command-line application for Arknights data checking  
[en]  
this is a python terminal for Arknights data searching.  
for developers:  
the data structure for "data.xp1"(acually txt file but a different postfix) is rather simple:  
[["name",height,[birthmonth,birthday],"foreign name",type,gender,star,organization,drawer,[infrastructure place],[infrastructure special],tag,race……]  
it's just a huge list with everything inside.  
to use this,"eval()" will be a great choice.  
also,description.xp1 is very similar to data.xp1,and it contains a dict instead of a list  
P.S.type,organization,gender,drawer,infrastructure place,infrastructure special,tag,race are stored in "int" mode,the translation tuple is in the terminal.  
for users:  
ignore everything above and just run the .exe file. Goodluck.  
[ch]  
开发者肯定看得懂上面在说什么  
为用户：  
下载所有文件，不要碰任何东西，运行"for user"文件夹里的.exe，完事儿。  
如果程序闪退了，那么肯定是出bug了，放弃吧（作为一只鸽子，补BUG的概率真的小）
